# Student Resources Web App and Search

## This is a fully functional web app where students can search or submit CS related resources
Live Website --> https://student-resources.herokuapp.com/

This project began because I needed a place to have all the CS resources I was using in order to build fullstack applications or study for technical interviews. I found myself with more than 100 tabs organized into folders on my browser. Whenever I went back to developing an application with a different language, it was difficult to pinpoint the resources I used before. I also wanted a way to provide all the resources needed to get started for people who were new to coding.
